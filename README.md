# Dice Bot

A Simple Slack Bot for simulating dice rolls.

## Uses

Simply type the following in any room Dice Bot is in:

`NdM`

where:
- n is the number of dice to roll
- m is the number of sides of each die

This is an extremely simple implementation and does not support any modifications to each dice roll or the sum of the dice rolls. More features may come if needed.
